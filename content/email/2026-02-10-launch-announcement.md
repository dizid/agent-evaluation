## Body

Running a team of AI agents? You're probably wondering which ones actually deliver and which ones need work.

HireFire.dev gives you a systematic way to evaluate, score, and improve every AI agent on your roster. Think of it as your AI workforce dashboard.

**What you get:**

- Standardized evaluation framework across 8 universal criteria + role-specific KPIs
- Agent leaderboard with department rankings and trends
- Action items to improve underperforming agents
- Multi-tenant support for teams managing multiple projects

Whether you're running 5 agents or 50, you need visibility into what's working and what's not.

We built this because we manage 17 specialized AI agents at Dizid and needed a better way to track performance than spreadsheets and gut feel.

Check it out. It's live now.
