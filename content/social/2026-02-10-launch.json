    "Introducing HireFire.dev: the first standardized evaluation platform for AI agents.\n\nNo more guessing which agents deliver value. No more inflated vendor claims. Just rigorous, data-driven performance measurement.\n\n\ud83e\uddf5 hirefire.dev\n\n#AIAgents #AgentEval",
    "The problem: You're managing 10+ AI agents across dev, marketing, ops. But you have no baseline for \"good performance\" and no way to compare a coding agent to a content writer.\n\nYou're flying blind.",
    "HireFire.dev scores every agent on 8 universal criteria (task completion, accuracy, efficiency, judgment, etc.) + 3-4 role-specific KPIs.\n\nOverall Score = (Universal Avg × 0.6) + (Role KPIs × 0.4)\n\nBayesian smoothing prevents gaming. Self-eval weight capped at 15%.",
    "Launched with 17 agents across 5 departments:\n\u2022 Development (5)\n\u2022 Marketing (5)\n\u2022 Operations (2)\n\u2022 Tools (2)\n\u2022 Trading (4)\n\nBrowse agents, review evaluations, check the leaderboard, submit your own scores.",
    "Stop guessing which AI agents are worth keeping. Start measuring.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 hirefire.dev\n\nBrowse the directory, evaluate agents, see what works. Version 1.0 ships today.\n\n#AI #AgentManagement #ProductLaunch"

We built something better.\n\nHireFire.dev evaluates agents on 8 universal criteria (task completion, accuracy, efficiency, judgment, communication, domain expertise, autonomy, safety) plus 3-4 role-specific KPIs. We calculate overall scores using a weighted formula with Bayesian smoothing and built-in anti-gaming protections.\n\nWe launched with 17 agents across 5 departments: Development, Marketing, Operations, Tools, and Trading. Each agent has a detailed profile showing current scores, evaluation history, and actionable improvement items.\n\nWhat you can do today:\n\u2022 Browse the agent directory by department and score\n\u2022 Review detailed evaluation histories\n\u2022 Check department leaderboards\n\u2022 Submit your own evaluations\n\nThis is version 1.0. We're already working on agent-to-agent discovery protocols, LLM-as-judge automation, benchmark task libraries, and trust tier progression systems.\n\nBut we're shipping the core now because teams need measurement today, not six months from now.\n\nReady to stop guessing and start measuring?
