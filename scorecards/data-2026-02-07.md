# Agent Evaluation: @Data
Date: 2026-02-07
Task: Analyze AgentEval evaluation data — agent rankings, criteria patterns, improvement recommendations
Evaluator: CEO (post-persona-improvement stress test)

## Persona Changes Applied This Cycle:
- Replaced vague "sanity-check row counts" with specific threshold (0 or >50K rows = pause + verify)
- Added data freshness rule (check MAX(created_at), flag if stale)
- Added CEO-ready output format (recommendation → table → next action)

## Universal Scores (1-10)
| Criterion | Score | Prev | Notes |
|-----------|-------|------|-------|
| Task Completion | 7/10 | 5.8 | All requested analyses delivered; cross-agent patterns identified |
| Accuracy | 7/10 | 5.8 | Queries ran correctly; handled JSONB edge case (non-numeric values) |
| Efficiency | 6/10 | 5.8 | 5 queries to get full picture — could consolidate |
| Judgment | 7/10 | 5.7 | Good call filtering out non-numeric score values; identified pattern |
| Communication | 8/10 | 5.7 | CEO-ready format with recommendation-first structure |
| Domain Expertise | 7/10 | 5.8 | Correct SQL, JSONB extraction, freshness check |
| Autonomy | 7/10 | 5.5 | Ran full analysis without needing guidance |
| Safety & Compliance | 7/10 | 6.2 | Read-only queries, no destructive operations |
| **Universal Avg** | **7.0/10** | **5.8** | +1.2 improvement |

## Role-Specific KPIs (1-10)
| KPI | Score | Prev | Notes |
|-----|-------|------|-------|
| Query Correctness | 7/10 | 6.0 | All queries returned valid data; handled JSONB edge case |
| ML Pipeline | N/A | 5.0 | Not tested this task |
| Insight Quality | 8/10 | 5.5 | Identified autonomy/efficiency as weakest universal criteria; @Data's own KPI breakdown was actionable |
| Data Freshness | 8/10 | 5.7 | Freshness check performed first; stated "Data current as of [timestamp]" |
| **Role Avg** | **7.7/10** | **5.7** | +2.0 improvement (excl. ML Pipeline) |

## Overall: 7.3/10 — Strong

Previous: 5.6/10 | Change: +1.7

## Top Strength:
Insight Quality — moved from raw data dumps to CEO-ready recommendations with supporting tables and clear next actions.

## Top Weakness:
Efficiency — took 5 separate queries when 2-3 could have covered the same ground with better SQL.

## Action Item:
Add to @Data: "Prefer fewer, richer queries over many simple ones. Use CTEs or subqueries to answer multiple questions in a single query when the data source is the same table."
