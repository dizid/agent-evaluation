# Agent Evaluation: @Growth
Date: 2026-02-07
Task: Persona improvement cycle — structural audit + fix
Evaluator: CEO (pre-stress-test, audit-based scoring)

## Persona Changes Applied This Cycle:
- Added daily spend breakdown requirement (Budget Awareness)
- Added WebSearch CPC verification requirement (Budget Awareness)
- Added exact tracking tool + event naming requirement (Measurability)
- Added full funnel mapping requirement (Strategic Thinking)
- Replaced vague measurement rule with specific tool+event instruction

## Gap Analysis (Before Fixes)

| KPI | Score | Gap |
|-----|-------|-----|
| Measurability | 5.0 | No tool/event specifics required |
| Budget Awareness | 5.3 | No daily breakdown, no CPC verification source |
| Strategic Thinking | 5.7 | No funnel mapping enforced |
| Channel Knowledge | 5.7 | Adequate but vague |

## Expected Impact
- Measurability: 5.0 → 7.0+ (specific tool+event naming forces precision)
- Budget Awareness: 5.3 → 7.0+ (daily breakdown + WebSearch CPC verification)
- Strategic Thinking: 5.7 → 7.0+ (full funnel mapping)

## Action Item:
Stress test with: "Design a 90-day GTM plan for AgentEval as a product. $200/month budget, 3 hours/week. Specific channels, daily budgets with CPC sources, measurement setup, weekly milestones."
